The aim of developing a CNN model to classify images of plastic waste is to create a system that can automatically identify and categorize different types of plastic waste by analyzing their images. This can help with sorting, recycling, and reducing environmental pollution.

Purpose:
The goal is to create a model that can look at an image of plastic waste and identify its type (e.g., bottle, bag, container). This helps with waste sorting and recycling processes.

Why CNNs?
CNNs are a type of deep learning model that are very effective at analyzing images. They can detect patterns like shapes, textures, and colors to make decisions.


Steps Involved:

Data Collection: Gather images of different types of plastic waste.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the images by resizing, normalizing, or augmenting them.
Model Design: Build a CNN architecture with layers that extract features and classify the images.
Training: Teach the model using labeled images, where the type of plastic is already known.
Testing: Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy on new, unseen images.
Deployment: Use the trained model in a real-world application, like a sorting system.

Technology Use:
Python, Jupyter, Streamlit, PyTorch, Matplotlib
